AIOStreams is brilliant inside Stremio. Outside it, though, you're stuck: Infuse, SenPlayer, Swiftfin and friends don't speak Stremio. This fork adds a Jellyfin‑compatible API on top of the current upstream AIOStreams, so those apps can log in and see your profile as if it were a Jellyfin server.

Your catalogs become libraries. Your metadata addon fills in posters, cast and seasons. Your stream addons provide the sources, and the player plays them directly. Watched state, resume and favourites are stored per profile. There is no Jellyfin server behind it and nothing is transcoded.

The Jellyfin layer was first written by [qooode](https://github.com/qooode/AIOStreams) against a development snapshot. This fork ports it onto upstream release tags and keeps it there, so you get every upstream AIOStreams release with the layer included.

## What you get

- **A real library view in your player.** Every catalog in the profile is a library; search catalogs work from the app's search box.
- **Proper metadata.** Posters, backdrops, logos, cast with photos and roles, directors and writers, age rating, TMDB and TVDB ids, season posters, episode thumbnails. All of it comes from the metadata addon in your profile, AioMetadata being the one this was built against.
- **Direct play from your sources.** The player gets your stream list with your own formatter labels and plays straight from the debrid or usenet link.
- **Per‑profile progress.** Resume, next up, watched and favourites live with the profile, so each family member has their own.
- **Built for TV apps.** The home screen of Infuse on Apple TV fires dozens of requests at once; the layer is tuned for that instead of Stremio's one‑row‑at‑a‑time pattern.

Tested with Infuse (tvOS, iOS, macOS) and SenPlayer. Swiftfin, Findroid, Streamyfin, the Jellyfin web and desktop clients and Kodi use the same API and should work; reports welcome.

## Run it

Use the image in place of `ghcr.io/viren070/aiostreams` and keep your existing environment. Pin a release tag rather than `release` if you want predictable upgrades.

```yaml
services:
  aiostreams:
    image: ghcr.io/tweakapps/aiostreams-jf:jf-v2.34.0-9   # see Releases for the latest
    environment:
      - ENABLE_JELLYFIN_API=true
      # ...your normal AIOStreams settings
```

Images are multi‑arch (amd64 and arm64) and built by GitHub Actions. Every tag on the [Releases](https://github.com/tweakapps/aiostreams-jf-update/releases) page has a matching image; `release` tracks the branch. Upgrade with `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

## Connect a player

1. Create or open a profile in AIOStreams and add a metadata addon to it (AioMetadata works well). Without one the libraries will be empty.
2. In your player, add a Jellyfin server at `https://your-host/jellyfin`.
3. Username is the profile **UUID**, password is the profile **password**.

That's it. Libraries, search, playback and progress all follow the profile.

## Settings

All optional. Defaults suit a household server.

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ENABLE_JELLYFIN_API` | `true` | Turns the Jellyfin API on or off. |
| `JELLYFIN_WINDOW` / `JELLYFIN_MAX` | `5` / `2000` | Rate limit for Jellyfin traffic, per device: requests per window in seconds. |
| `JELLYFIN_ATTACH_SOURCES_CLIENTS` | `SenPlayer` | Players that want the full source list on the item page (for a version picker) rather than at play time. Comma‑separated, matched by client name. |
| `JELLYFIN_ALWAYS_ATTACH_SOURCES` | `false` | Do that for every client. Slower item pages; only if your player needs it. |
| `JELLYFIN_MAX_PLAYBACK_SOURCES` | `20` | How many sources a player is offered at play time. Clients in the list above always get 50. |
| `JELLYFIN_MAX_CATALOG_ITEMS` | `0` (off) | Cap on items per library for apps that crawl everything. |
| `JELLYFIN_LOOKUP_CONCURRENCY` | `8` | How many items one list request resolves at once. |
| `JELLYFIN_RELAY_TIMEOUT` | `15000` | Milliseconds to wait for an upstream image or subtitle to start responding. |

## Good to know

- **Tokens are secrets.** The token a player stores after login embeds your encrypted profile password and can't be revoked. Treat it like the password.
- **Aliases are open.** An alias login accepts any password, because aliases are share links. Don't alias a profile you expose through this layer unless you mean it to be open.
- **Metadata addon check‑ins.** Some metadata addons report "watching" to Trakt or Simkl when subtitles are requested. Leave that addon's subtitles resource off in profiles you use through this layer, or you'll get check‑ins that don't match real playback.
- **Players do their own subtitles.** Infuse and SenPlayer fetch subtitles themselves, and embedded tracks play as usual. Add a subtitle addon to the profile if you want more.

## Releases and changes

One release per update, each with its own notes: [Releases](https://github.com/tweakapps/aiostreams-jf-update/releases). The same history in one file: [CHANGELOG‑JF.md](CHANGELOG-JF.md).

Branches: `release` is the default and what images are built from, upstream's latest tag plus the layer. `main` mirrors upstream development and is left untouched, so new upstream versions merge cleanly.

## ✨ What is AIOStreams?

AIOStreams was created to give users ultimate control over their Stremio experience. Instead of juggling multiple addons with different configurations and limitations, AIOStreams acts as a central hub. It fetches results from all your configured sources, then deduplicates, filters, sorts, and formats them according to _your_ rules before presenting them in a single, clean list.

Whether you're a casual user who wants a simple, unified stream list or a power user who wants to fine-tune every aspect of your results, AIOStreams has you covered.

### 🧩 Built-in Addons

AIOStreams ships with a suite of its own addons - search engines and integrations that are hosted alongside AIOStreams itself and available exclusively to your instance. They're configured and used just like any other addon in the marketplace.

> [!NOTE]
> Built-in addons that search for torrents require a debrid service. Usenet results can be streamed by AIOStreams' own built-in usenet engine, via external tools like [NzbDAV](https://github.com/nzbdav-dev/nzbdav) or [AltMount](https://github.com/javi11/altmount), natively by Stremio itself, or through TorBox (Pro plan) - see the [Usenet guide](https://docs.aiostreams.viren070.me/guides/usenet). All built-in addons support anime and Kitsu/MAL catalogs.

The built-in addons include:

| Addon               | Description                                                      |

| **NZBHydra2**       | Connect your NZBHydra2 instance to search Usenet indexers.       |
| **Newznab**         | Directly configure any Newznab-compatible Usenet indexer.        |
| **Torznab**         | Configure any Torznab API to search torrent results.             |
| **Library**         | Browse and stream content from your debrid/usenet library        |

### 🌐 Debrid & Usenet Service Support

AIOStreams supports all major debrid and Usenet services, including:

**Debrid**: Real-Debrid, AllDebrid, Debrid-Link, Premiumize, TorBox, EasyDebrid, PikPak, Offcloud, Seedr, put.io, and more.

**Usenet**: the built-in usenet engine (streams straight from your own NNTP provider), Easynews, NzbDAV, AltMount, Stremio NNTP, StremThru Newz.

Services are configured once in the **Services** tab and automatically applied to every compatible addon in your configuration.

</p>

### 🔬 Advanced Filtering Engine

Because every addon is routed through AIOStreams, you only configure your filters **once** and they apply universally.

- **Property Filters**: Include, require, or exclude results by resolution (240p–2160p), quality (CAM through BluRay REMUX), encode (AVC, HEVC, AV1...), HDR/Dolby Vision tags, audio format (Atmos, TrueHD, DTS...), audio channels, stream type (debrid, usenet, P2P...), and language.
- **Size, Bitrate & Seeder Filters**: Set minimum and maximum bounds for file size, bitrate, seeder count, and result age.
- **Cached/Uncached Control**: Filter by cache status globally or scoped to specific services or addons.
- **Keyword Filters**: Match or exclude results by simple keyword against the filename.
- **Regex Filters**: Full regular expression matching against filenames, indexer names, and release groups.
- **Stream Expression Language (SEL)**: Write dynamic conditional rules using a purpose-built expression language.
  - _Example_: Only remove 720p results when more than five 1080p results are already present: `count(resolution(streams, '1080p')) > 5 ? resolution(streams, '720p') : false`
  - Full reference: [docs.aiostreams.viren070.me/reference/stream-expressions](https://docs.aiostreams.viren070.me/reference/stream-expressions)
- **Accurate Matching**: Uses various metadata sources to precisely verify titles, years, and episode numbers - so you only ever see the right content. Can be applied per-addon or per-content type.
- **Smart Deduplication**: Detect duplicate streams by filename, infohash, or a "smart detect" hash computed from a configurable set of file attributes (size, resolution, encode, release group, etc.).

</p>

### 📊 Powerful Sorting

Build your ideal sort order from a wide range of criteria - resolution, quality, encode, language, audio, visual tags, stream type, cache status, seeders, size, bitrate, service, addon, age, and more. Sorting is:

- **Fully Customisable**: Stack any number of criteria in any order.
- **Content-Aware**: Define separate sort orders for movies, series, and anime, and separate rules for cached vs. uncached results.
- **Expression/Regex Scored**: Use Stream Expressions / Regex Patterns to compute a numeric score per stream and sort by that score for maximum precision.
- **Preferred Lists**: Define ranked lists of preferred values (e.g. prefer `HDR10+` over `HDR` over `SDR`) and have the sorter use those rankings automatically.

</p>

### 🎨 Custom Stream Formatter

Design exactly how stream information appears in Stremio using a powerful templating system.

- **Live Preview**: See exactly what your streams will look like as you build your template.
- **Built-in Formats**: Start from one of the included presets - some are built in, others are inspired by popular addons and community contributions.
- **Full Customisation**: The template system gives you access to every parsed stream attribute. See the [Custom Formatter reference](https://docs.aiostreams.viren070.me/reference/custom-formatter) for the full variable and function list.

</p>

### 🗃️ Unified Catalog Management

Take control of your Stremio home page from one place.

- **Rename**: Rename any catalog's title or type to whatever you want.
- **Reorder & Disable**: Drag catalogs into your preferred order or hide the ones you don't use.
- **Shuffle**: Discover new content by shuffling the results of any catalog. You can persist the shuffle for a set period.
- **Enhanced Posters**: Automatically upgrade catalog posters with high-quality artwork from supported poster services (e.g. [RPDB](https://rpdb.net/)) - even for addons that don't natively support it.
- **Merged Catalogs**: Combine results from multiple catalogs into one unified catalog.

<p align="center">

</p>

### 🛡️ Proxy Support

- **Built-in Proxy**: AIOStreams includes its own proxy for forwarding streams.
- **External Proxy**: Integrate with [MediaFlow Proxy](https://github.com/mhdzumair/mediaflow-proxy) or [StremThru](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/stremthru) by providing your instance URL and credentials.
- **Bypass IP Restrictions**: Essential for debrid services that restrict simultaneous connections from different IP addresses.
- **NZB Proxying**: The built-in proxy can also forward NZB download requests for the Newznab built-in addon.
- **Outgoing Request Proxy**: Route AIOStreams' own requests to upstream addons through an HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy - useful when your server's IP is blocked by an upstream service.
